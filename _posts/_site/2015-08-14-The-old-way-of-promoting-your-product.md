Berlin is a interesting place to live. Amount of activities, people, cultures and industry is crazy. 
Each time you go outside you can meet interesting people from very different enviroments. 
Today when waiting for sbahn train to Neukoln I was asked by just a random guy to help him to review his flyer. 
What he expected from me was to answer if looking at his small piece of leaflet I was able to find out easilly what his startup idea was about.

I have never experienced such a way of promoting/QA-ing product idea. I started thinking ... does this way make even sense? How much people can you actually ask? Are those people realible testing group?

On the other side what are other options for small, self-started businesses? 
Should you send email to random people hoping that someone will actually respond? Where to get those emails from? 
What did this group apply to target group you actually expect?
Maybe hiring agency which should do this better? What about costs?

I asked Florian (this is his name) why did he asked me for an oppinion? The answer was that I fit his target group and basing on T-shirt I know english and it was easy to start conversation.
